# NoCoin adblock list
This is an adblock list to block "browser-based crypto mining". Currently there are a few websites added into the lists. If you see other websites supporting these deeds, then feel free to raise an **Issue** or **Pull request** for it to be taken care of.

## Installation

## Hosts based blocking
For the blocking based on the [HOSTS file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)) use the below link:
- [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoshsadiq/adblock-nocoin-list/master/hosts.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoshsadiq/adblock-nocoin-list/master/hosts.txt)

### hosts
You can simply copy and paste the contents of above file into your hosts file. The locations of your hosts file depends on your system:
- Linux: `/etc/hosts`
- MacOS: `/etc/hosts`
- Windows: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`

Whichever OS you use, you will require escalated privileges to edit the file (either use `sudo` for Linux/MacOS or administrative account on Windows). Or you can use command below for linux

```
sudo -- sh -c 'curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoshsadiq/adblock-nocoin-list/master/hosts.txt >> /etc/hosts'
```

_Mining (Opt-in **and** opt-out) will be blocked by default. If you see that mining is important, you would have to [whitelist](https://adblockplus.org/filters#whitelist) the website you actually want to support._
