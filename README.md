## Hosts based blocking
For the blocking based on the [HOSTS file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)) use the below link:
- [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoshsadiq/adblock-nocoin-list/master/hosts.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoshsadiq/adblock-nocoin-list/master/hosts.txt)

### hosts
You can simply copy and paste the contents of above file into your hosts file. The locations of your hosts file depends on your system:
- Linux: `/etc/hosts`
- MacOS: `/etc/hosts`
- Windows: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`

Whichever OS you use, you will require escalated privileges to edit the file (either use `sudo` for Linux/MacOS or administrative account on Windows)

### Perimeter blocking
You may use the hosts file with below applications to block these miners on whole networks. Simply add the link to the above hosts file in each system.
